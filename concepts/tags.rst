What is a tag?
==============

A tag (also know has "hashtag") is a word starting with a hash (#). It helps
indexing and search entries through the Wididit networks.

Tag trees
=========

Other social network softwares (such as Twitter or StatusNet) implement
a basic hashtag system, but not as much powerful as Wididit's.

Wididit also supports tag trees. Think of tag trees as a filesystem tree,
or a newsgroup name , but separated by hashs (#) instead of slashes (/) or
dots (.).
For example, when you write `#wididit#python`, it means you are dealing
with Wididit, and more precisely the Python API.

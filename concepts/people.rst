People are users. We call them people for historical reasons (because SeenThis
does, actually).

.. _userid:

Userid
========

Userid are unique user identifiers through all Wididit networks. They are
mostly formed as email addresses: `username@servername.tld`.

No sanity check is done on the server name.

If the second part of the userid (ie. `@servername.tld`) is omitted, it
defaults to the server you are making the query to.

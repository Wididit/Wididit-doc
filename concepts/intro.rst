We could have called Wididit "Yet another distributed social network", or
something like that. However, we named it Wididit, because we didn't know
doing a perfect social network is impossible, so we did it.

For us, critical critereas for a social network are:

* distributed: anyone can create his own server and link it with existing
  one easily and safely.
* libre (aka. free and open source): anyone can read, modify and reuse the
  source code of the server and client libraries.
* user privacy: anyone should be able to remove its data from the network.
* no dependence: anyone should be able to move its account from a server
  to another easily.
